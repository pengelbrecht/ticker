Append to title: \"Task title [approval]\" or \"Task title (👤 approval)\"\n2. Show in detail pane when task is selected\n3. Different icons per awaiting type (more complex)\n\nRecommended: Option 1 - append abbreviated type after title for quick scanning.\n\nFile: internal/tui/model.go - RenderTask() method (around line 86-99)\n\nExample output:\n```\n👤 [abc123] Fix auth flow [approval]\n👤 [def456] Configure API key [input]\n👤 [ghi789] Review PR #42 [review]\n```\n\nThe bracketed type helps users understand what action they need to take.",
