  "description": "Task list jumps around confusingly during execution. Implement grouped sorting:\n\n1. Completed tasks (in execution order they finished)\n2. In-progress task (current)\n3. Pending tasks (in tk's priority/blocker order)\n\nTrack execution order internally as tasks start. Completed tasks stay stable at top in the order they ran, giving clear progress indication. Pending tasks below hint at what's next.",

  "closed_reason": "Implemented task list sorting by status groups: (1) completed tasks sorted by execution order, (2) in-progress task, (3) pending tasks. Added taskExecOrder map and nextExecOrder counter to Model. Modified IterationStartMsg handler to track execution order and TasksUpdateMsg handler to sort tasks and preserve selection. Added sortTasks() method with stable sort. Added 3 tests for sorting behavior."
