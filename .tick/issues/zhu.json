  "description": "Task list jumps around confusingly during execution. Implement grouped sorting:\n\n1. Completed tasks (in execution order they finished)\n2. In-progress task (current)\n3. Pending tasks (in tk's priority/blocker order)\n\nTrack execution order internally as tasks start. Completed tasks stay stable at top in the order they ran, giving clear progress indication. Pending tasks below hint at what's next.",
