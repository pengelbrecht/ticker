No code changes required - this was a test task for parallel execution testing.\n2026-01-13 09:39 - Iteration 1: Verification failed for task 1pg. [git] M internal/engine/engine.go | M internal/engine/engine_test.go Please fix and close the task again.\n2026-01-13 09:39 - Iteration 2: Completed task 1pg (3+3=6). Also committed pre-existing engine changes that added TotalCost/TotalTokens to RunResult - these were left uncommitted from a previous task and caused the verification failure in iteration 1.\n2026-01-13 09:40 - Iteration 3: Completed task vk0 (Echo hello). Simple output task - printed 'Hello World'. No code changes required, this was a test task for parallel execution testing.",
