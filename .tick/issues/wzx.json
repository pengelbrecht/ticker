  "closed_reason": "Fixed buildRunRecordContent() to iterate tools in reverse order (newest first). The agent stores ToolHistory oldest-first via append, but display should show most recent tools at the top. Changed iteration from ascending (0 to showCount) to descending (totalTools-1 to totalTools-showCount). Added test TestBuildRunRecordContent_ToolsDescendingOrder to verify ordering. Files modified: internal/tui/model.go, internal/tui/model_test.go."
