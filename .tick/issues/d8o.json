  "description": "Add requires, awaiting, and verdict fields to tick schema. Implement CLI commands (tk approve, tk reject) and flags (--requires, --awaiting, --verdict). Handle backwards compatibility with manual field.",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 17:41 - Completed ztr: Added Requires (*string), Awaiting (*string), and Verdict (*string) pointer fields to Task struct in internal/ticks/types.go. Used pointer types so nil represents 'not set' and omitempty works correctly for JSON. Added IsAwaitingHuman() and GetAwaitingType() helper methods. All tests pass.\n2026-01-14 17:44 - Completed agk: Implemented backwards compatibility for manual field. Key changes: (1) IsAwaitingHuman() and GetAwaitingType() now check Manual field as fallback when Awaiting is nil - treating manual=true as awaiting=work. (2) Added SetAwaiting(type) method that clears Manual when setting Awaiting, and ClearAwaiting() that clears both. (3) No query filter changes were needed since ticker uses tk next which handles filtering via CLI. The pattern reads both fields but writes only the new awaiting field.\n2026-01-14 17:45 - Completed 2z9: Added SetAwaiting and ClearAwaiting methods to ticks Client. Methods delegate to tk CLI using 'tk update --awaiting \u003cvalue\u003e' pattern. SetAwaiting accepts optional note for context. Note: These methods assume tk CLI supports --awaiting flag - if tk hasn't been updated yet, these will error at runtime. Added after SetStatus method at line ~207 in client.go.",
