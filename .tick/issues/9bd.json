  "description": "Build comprehensive test suite for agent-human workflow. Test all signal types, verdict processing, handoff flows, and worktree integration. Ensure edge cases are covered.",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 19:01 - Completed [crp]: Updated mockTicksClient with full awaiting/verdict workflow support. Key additions: (1) State maps for tracking awaiting, verdict, and structured notes; (2) SetAwaiting/SetVerdict methods with call tracking for assertions; (3) GetHumanNotes filters by author; (4) SimulateVerdictProcessing helper mirrors Task.ProcessVerdict logic from types.go; (5) Tests verify all verdict processing scenarios (approval, review, content, work, input, escalation, checkpoint). Mock now ready for integration tests.\n2026-01-14 19:02 - Completed [hwx]: Added comprehensive signal parsing tests. Key additions: (1) TestParseSignals_AllTypes - matches task spec exactly, covers all 9 signals with context; (2) TestParseSignals_SignalPriority - tests full priority chain; (3) TestParseSignals_EdgeCases - tests malformed tags, unicode, whitespace trimming, empty contexts, nested tags; (4) Extended existing TestParseSignals with 16 more edge cases. Total 87 test cases all passing. File: internal/engine/signals_test.go\n2026-01-14 19:07 - Completed [x34]: Added comprehensive handleSignal tests. Key changes: (1) Introduced TicksClient interface in engine.go to enable dependency injection for testing - Engine now accepts TicksClient interface instead of *ticks.Client; (2) 5 new test functions covering all signal→awaiting mappings, requires field logic, context passing, and unknown signal handling; (3) Updated mockTicksClient with closedTasks map (map[string]bool) for easier assertions. This refactoring pattern can be reused for other engine methods that need testing.\n2026-01-14 19:10 - Completed [8fm]: Added verdict_test.go in internal/engine with comprehensive unit tests (82+ cases). Key coverage: (1) TestVerdictProcessing covers all 14 awaiting×verdict combinations with wantBackTo field; (2) TestVerdictProcessing_RequiresNotCleared exhaustively tests requires persistence across ALL 42 awaiting/verdict combos (3 requires × 7 awaiting × 2 verdicts); (3) TestVerdictProcessing_TransientFieldsCleared verifies Awaiting/Verdict/Manual are cleared for all scenarios including unknown types; (4) TestVerdictProcessing_RejectionCycle tests full rejection→resubmit→approval workflow. Note: ticks package already had TestTaskProcessVerdict in client_test.go - the new tests complement those with additional edge cases and the exact format specified in the task.",
