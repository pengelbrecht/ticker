  "notes": "2026-01-14 19:01 - Completed [crp]: Updated mockTicksClient with full awaiting/verdict workflow support. Key additions: (1) State maps for tracking awaiting, verdict, and structured notes; (2) SetAwaiting/SetVerdict methods with call tracking for assertions; (3) GetHumanNotes filters by author; (4) SimulateVerdictProcessing helper mirrors Task.ProcessVerdict logic from types.go; (5) Tests verify all verdict processing scenarios (approval, review, content, work, input, escalation, checkpoint). Mock now ready for integration tests.\n2026-01-14 19:02 - Completed [hwx]: Added comprehensive signal parsing tests. Key additions: (1) TestParseSignals_AllTypes - matches task spec exactly, covers all 9 signals with context; (2) TestParseSignals_SignalPriority - tests full priority chain; (3) TestParseSignals_EdgeCases - tests malformed tags, unicode, whitespace trimming, empty contexts, nested tags; (4) Extended existing TestParseSignals with 16 more edge cases. Total 87 test cases all passing. File: internal/engine/signals_test.go",
