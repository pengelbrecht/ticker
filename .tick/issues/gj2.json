  "closed_reason": "Fixed completion modal width to prevent token count wrapping. The token display was already implemented in both status bar (lines 1856-1867) and completion modal (lines 2592-2602), but the modal width of 42 was too narrow for longer token strings with cache. Increased modal width to 48 to accommodate 'X in | Y out | Z cache' format without line breaks."
