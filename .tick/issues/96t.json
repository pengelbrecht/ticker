    "output": "Looking at the epic notes, I can see that:\n1. Task 96t was completed (2+2=4) but verification failed due to uncommitted changes in `internal/engine/engine.go` and `internal/engine/engine_test.go`\n2. I need to fix this by either committing or reverting these changes\n\nLet me first understand what changes exist in these files.\n\nThese look like legitimate changes - adding budget usage (cost and tokens) to run results. Let me check if these changes are complete and tests pass.\n\nAll tests pass. Let me also run the full test suite to make sure everything is working.\n\nAll tests pass. Now I understand the situation:\n\n1. The current task (96t) is \"What is 2+2?\" - the answer is **4**\n2. The previous iteration answered this correctly but verification failed because there were uncommitted code changes\n3. These changes (adding budget usage to RunResult) look like work from a different task that wasn't committed\n\nI need to commit these changes before closing the task. Let me check if there's a related task ID for these changes.\n\nI see there's a recent commit `098506f feat(engine): Include cost and token usage in RunResult [1pg]` but the working directory still has the same changes. This seems like the changes are already committed but git status shows them as modified. Let me check.\n\nThe working tree is clean. The changes have already been committed. The git status shown at the start of the conversation was a snapshot from before and is now outdated.\n\nThe task is simple: **2 + 2 = 4**\n\nNow I need to close the task and leave an epic note.\n\nTask 96t completed. The answer is **4**. The verification failure from the previous iteration was due to a stale git status snapshot - the working tree is now clean as the engine changes were already committed.",
