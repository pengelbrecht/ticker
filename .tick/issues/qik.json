    "output": "I'll start by reading the main.go file to list all CLI subcommands defined.\n\nBased on my analysis of `cmd/ticker/main.go`, I can now list all the CLI subcommands defined. Let me close the task with the findings.\n\nTask completed. I read `cmd/ticker/main.go` and identified the following CLI subcommands defined:\n\n1. **run** (line 53) - Run one or more epics with the AI agent. Supports single/multiple epics, TUI/headless modes, worktrees, and parallel execution.\n\n2. **resume** (line 77) - Resume from a saved checkpoint. Takes a checkpoint ID as argument.\n\n3. **checkpoints** (line 87) - List available checkpoints, optionally filtered by epic ID.\n\n4. **upgrade** (line 98) - Download and install the latest version of ticker.\n\nThe root command `ticker` is defined at line 38, and subcommands are added to it in the `init()` function at lines 145-148.",
