  "description": "Parallel mode's loadTasksForEpic only sends EpicTasksUpdateMsg but doesn't fetch/send RunRecords for closed tasks. This means the 'Run Summary' detail view (duration, tokens, cost, tools, etc.) is missing in parallel mode.\n\nFix: Add RunRecord loading to loadTasksForEpic similar to single-epic mode's refreshTasks (main.go:836-843). May need new EpicTaskRunRecordMsg message type.",
