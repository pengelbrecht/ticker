  "title": "Rebuild TUI using ticks-style architecture",
  "description": "Complete rewrite of the ticker TUI to match the ticks TUI patterns. The new TUI needs 3 panes: top status bar, left task list, right detail/output pane. Uses Catppuccin Mocha colors, single-file model.go architecture, and consistent keybindings with ticks.",
  "notes": "2026-01-11 21:19 - Created model.go scaffold (task 6lh). The tui package compiles independently but main.go build currently fails because it references old TUI API (tui.New, tui.Config, tui.TaskInfo, etc). This is expected - task pjf will update main.go. Key pattern followed: single-file model.go with keyMap implementing help.KeyMap interface, init() forcing COLORTERM=truecolor, and Model struct with minimal fields. Catppuccin Mocha footerStyle added as starting point for color palette.\n2026-01-11 21:21 - Completed task 7nj. Added full Catppuccin Mocha color palette as typed constants (not raw hex in styles) and base lipgloss styles. All styles match ticks TUI exactly. The tui package compiles independently. Styles ready for use: headerStyle, panelStyle, selectedStyle, dimStyle, footerStyle, labelStyle, plus priority/status/type semantic styles.\n2026-01-11 21:23 - Completed task uq6. Added all keybindings to keyMap struct: PageUp/PageDown (pgup/pgdown), Help (?), Pause (p), SwitchPane (tab). FullHelp() returns 3 columns: [Up/Down/Top/Bottom], [ScrollUp/ScrollDn/PageUp/PageDown], [Pause/SwitchPane/Help/Quit]. Key handlers added to Update() with TODO comments for implementation. tui package compiles independently.\n2026-01-11 21:25 - Completed task fkz. Added FocusedPane enum (PaneStatus/PaneTasks/PaneOutput), TaskStatus enum, TaskInfo struct with BlockedBy as []string (matching main.go expectation). Model struct now has all state fields organized into groups: epic/run state, budget tracking, UI state, components, layout, communication. viewport.Model from bubbles imported. tui package compiles independently but main.go still fails (expected - task pjf will fix). Next tasks should build on this foundation by adding messages (pjf), Config struct, and New() constructor.\n2026-01-11 21:26 - Completed task ttw. Added TaskInfo helper methods (IsBlocked, StatusIcon, RenderTask) and IsCurrent field. StatusIcon uses the Catppuccin color palette constants from task 7nj. RenderTask uses selectedStyle and dimStyle for visual differentiation. Fixed TaskStatusInProgress to use underscore ('in_progress') per spec. tui package compiles independently; main.go still fails as expected (task pjf will fix).\n2026-01-11 21:27 - 2026-01-11 21:27 - Completed task l7b. Added all message types for engine-\u003eTUI communication: tickMsg (animation heartbeat), IterationStartMsg, IterationEndMsg, OutputMsg, SignalMsg (COMPLETE/EJECT/BLOCKED), ErrorMsg, RunCompleteMsg, TasksUpdateMsg. Added tickCmd() function that returns tea.Tick for 1-second heartbeat using tea.Tick(time.Second, ...). All types placed in dedicated section after TaskInfo helpers. tui package compiles independently; main.go still fails as expected (future task will fix).",
