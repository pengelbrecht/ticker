  "description": "Add ensureEpicContext() to engine that generates context before first task.\n\n## Requirements\n- Check if context exists before starting epic\n- Generate if missing and epic has \u003e1 children\n- Skip generation for single-task epics (no amortization benefit)\n- Load context and inject into IterationContext\n- Handle generation failures gracefully (proceed without context)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `ensureEpicContext(ctx, epicID) error` method on Engine\n- [ ] `loadEpicContext(epicID) (string, error)` method on Engine\n- [ ] Context generated before first iteration\n- [ ] Skipped if epic has ≤1 children\n- [ ] Skipped if context already exists\n- [ ] Generation failure logs warning but doesn't abort run\n- [ ] EpicContext populated in every IterationContext\n\n## Integration Points\n- Call ensureEpicContext at start of Engine.Run()\n- Inject context.Store and context.Generator into Engine\n- Add context fields to EngineConfig",
