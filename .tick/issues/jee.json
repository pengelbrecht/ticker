  "closed_reason": "Added newline separator between multiple text content blocks in stream parser. When a new text block starts and there's already output content, adds '\\n\\n' separator to prevent direct concatenation (e.g., multi-turn responses where text-\u003etool-\u003etext would concat without spacing). Added tests for multi-turn scenarios and verified thinking-\u003etext doesn't add extra separators. Modified internal/agent/stream.go."
