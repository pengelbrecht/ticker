  "closed_reason": "Added updateSelectedTaskView() helper method that updates the details pane when selection changes. Modified j/k/g/G/pgup/pgdown handlers to call this method when selectedTask changes. For the current (in-progress) task, shows live output; for closed tasks, shows RunRecord detail view; otherwise shows historical output. Updated footer to show 'esc:live' hint when viewing historical data instead of Enter hint."
