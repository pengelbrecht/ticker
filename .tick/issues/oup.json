    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the epic notes and understanding what needs to be summarized. The task says \"Summarize findings after the count task is done\" - I need to find out what the \"count task\" was and what findings need to be summarized.\n\nLet me first check the epic notes and the current task details.\n\nNow I understand. This task was blocked by task `4df` (the count task), which counted .go files in the internal/ directory and found 35 files. My task is to summarize the findings from that count task.\n\nLet me check what task 4df was about:\n\nThe count task found 35 .go files in the internal/ directory. This task asks me to summarize those findings. Since this is a TUI test epic with simple tasks for testing the ticker TUI, I'll provide a summary of what was found.\n\n**Summary of Count Task Findings:**\n\nThe count task (4df) examined the `internal/` directory of the ticker project and found **35 Go source files (.go)**. These files are organized across several packages:\n\n- `internal/agent/` - AI agent interface and implementations (Claude, etc.)\n- `internal/budget/` - Cost, token, and iteration tracking\n- `internal/checkpoint/` - Save/resume state functionality\n- `internal/engine/` - Core Ralph loop orchestration\n- `internal/ticks/` - Ticks CLI wrapper\n- `internal/tui/` - Bubble Tea TUI implementation\n\nThis file count indicates a moderately-sized Go project with well-organized internal packages following Go's convention of keeping implementation details in the `internal/` directory.\n\nNow I'll close the task and add an epic note:\n\nLet me verify the task was closed and check if there are remaining tasks:\n\nAll 7 tasks in the epic are now closed. The task has been completed successfully.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Reviewed the findings from count task 4df which found 35 .go files in the internal/ directory\n- Closed task oup with a reason summarizing the findings\n- Added an epic note for future reference\n- No code changes were required as this was a simple read-only summary task",
