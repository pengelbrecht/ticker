  "notes": "2026-01-14 22:17 - Completed 5pp: Added auto-commit for dirty tick files. Key changes: (1) IsOnlyTickFilesDirty() checks if all dirty files are in .tick/ directory, (2) AutoCommitTickFiles() stages and commits with 'chore: auto-commit tick status updates' message, (3) Both TUI and headless parallel run paths updated to use auto-commit when only tick files dirty. Mixed dirty files still fail. Tests added in worktree_test.go.",
