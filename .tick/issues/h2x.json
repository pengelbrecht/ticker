This ensures that if a later iteration times out or fails, the previous work isn't lost.\n\nImplementation:\n- After iteration completes successfully (no error)\n- Run git add -A \u0026\u0026 git commit with iteration info in message\n- Only if there are actual changes to commit\n- Include task ID and iteration number in commit message\n- Skip if no changes detected (git status clean)",
