  "title": "Integrate rich agent streaming into TUI",
  "description": "Integrate the new agent streaming data layer (AgentState, StreamParser, RunRecord) into the ticker TUI. This enables real-time display of thinking, output, tool activity, and detailed metrics during agent runs, plus viewing completed tick results.",
  "notes": "2026-01-11 22:35 - b35 complete: Added agentState *agent.AgentState field to Model struct at line 294. Import added at line 19. The field is nil by default and will need to be populated when engine starts a run. Next tasks should: (1) create AgentStateMsg type to send state updates to TUI, (2) update engine to create AgentState and stream parse to it, (3) update TUI to render from agentState when non-nil. The existing output field still works so backward compatibility is preserved.",
