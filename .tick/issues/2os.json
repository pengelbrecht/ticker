  "notes": "2026-01-12 09:06 - Completed x1h: Increased DefaultAgentTimeout from 5 minutes to 30 minutes. Changes in internal/engine/engine.go (constant and comment) and internal/engine/engine_test.go (test assertion). Simple config change with no architectural impact.\n2026-01-12 09:09 - Completed 8lh: Fixed status bar to show cumulative token totals (totalInputTokens + liveInputTokens) instead of just liveInputTokens. Also removed cost override in RunCompleteMsg handler since cost is already accumulated via IterationEndMsg. Key insight: the Model has both 'live' metrics (current iteration, reset on IterationStartMsg) and 'total' metrics (accumulated across iterations). Status bar should show totals+live, completion modal should show totals.\n2026-01-12 09:13 - Completed wzx: Fixed tools list to show most recent first. The key insight is that agent.AgentState.ToolHistory stores tools oldest-first (via append in stream.go:363), while tui.Model.toolHistory stores newest-first (via prepend in model.go:1071). The fix was in buildRunRecordContent() which displays RunRecord tools - changed iteration from ascending (oldest first) to descending (newest first). The live tool display in buildToolActivitySection() was already correct since TUI's toolHistory uses prepend.\n2026-01-12 09:18 - Completed 6xw: Separated thinking display into its own fixed area. Key design decisions: (1) Used lastThought field + extractLastThought() to show only most recent paragraph, (2) renderThinkingArea() creates a bordered box with brain emoji header, (3) Thinking area is rendered before viewport in renderOutputPane(), not inside buildOutputContent(). The full thinking history is still kept in m.thinking for RunRecord storage. Tests updated to reflect new behavior - buildOutputContent no longer contains thinking section.\n2026-01-12 09:22 - Completed zhu: Task list now sorts by status groups (completed/in-progress/pending). Key implementation details: (1) Model.taskExecOrder map tracks when each task started, (2) sortTasks() uses stable sort to group by status then order completed by execution sequence, (3) Selection tracking preserved across re-sorts by remembering selected task ID. The sorting is triggered both on TasksUpdateMsg and IterationStartMsg.\n2026-01-12 09:27 - Completed gst: Graceful timeout handling now captures partial output and adds detailed notes. Key design: (1) ErrTimeout sentinel error in agent package allows returning both error and partial Result, (2) Engine checks IsTimeout flag separately from Error to handle timeouts differently, (3) buildTimeoutNote() truncates output to last 500 chars for readability in notes. The partial RunRecord is still persisted on timeout for debugging via TUI.\n2026-01-12 09:29 - Completed inw: Disabled cost ceiling by default. Key insight: budget.Tracker already handles MaxCost=0 as unlimited (line 105 only checks if \u003e 0), and TUI already shows just cost without target when maxCost=0. Changes were minimal: (1) DefaultMaxCost constant changed from 20.00 to 0, (2) Removed default application in Run(), (3) Updated CLI flag default from 20.0 to 0.
