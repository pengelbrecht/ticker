  "description": "Implement watch mode for ticker to idle when no tasks available. Add orphaned/standalone task support. Handle race conditions with debounce.",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 21:46 - Watch mode implemented [dnk]: Added --watch, --timeout, --poll flags. Engine now idles when no tasks available and polls at configurable interval (default 10s). OnIdle callback triggers [IDLE] output in headless mode and IdleMsg in TUI. Watch timeout returns ExitReasonWatchTimeout which preserves worktree for resume. All tests pass.\n2026-01-14 21:51 - Debounce implemented [32y]: Added --debounce flag for optional wait before task pickup. Waits configurable interval then re-fetches task via GetTask to capture human edits. Default 0 (disabled) for backwards compat. Works with context cancellation. Tests cover no-debounce, with-debounce, no-task, context-cancelled, and negative-interval cases.\n2026-01-14 21:55 - Standalone task support implemented [h5t]: Added NextTaskWithOptions() with functional options (WithEpic, StandaloneOnly). ListAllTasks() gets all open tasks, findReadyTaskFromList() handles priority sorting and filters awaiting/blocked/manual. Engine integration not changed - engine still uses NextTask(epicID). Future work could update engine to use NextTaskWithOptions when running without epic.\n2026-01-14 22:34 - File watcher implemented [vzt]: Added TicksWatcher using fsnotify to watch .tick/issues for JSON file changes. Falls back to no-op (polling-only) if directory doesn't exist or fsnotify unavailable. 100ms debounce default, configurable via WithDebounceDelay(). Integration in handleWatchIdle creates watcher on each idle entry and closes on exit. File changes trigger immediate task check vs waiting for poll interval. Tests confirm detection, debouncing, JSON-only filtering.\n2026-01-14 22:43 - Orphaned task support implemented [txv]: Added runStandaloneTask function that handles standalone and orphaned tasks. Key behavior: (1) processes tasks directly without requiring epic context, (2) retrieves parent epic info for context even if closed, (3) continues to next task based on --include-standalone and --include-orphans flags with priority ordering (standalone before orphans). The function uses the existing OrphanedOnly() and StandaloneOnly() functional options from ticks client. All existing tests pass plus new orphan-specific tests added.\n2026-01-14 22:43 - Iteration 1: Verification failed for task txv. [git] M internal/ticks/client.go Please fix and close the task again.\n2026-01-14 22:45 - Orphaned task support fully committed [txv]: Previous iteration's work was complete but uncommitted. Committed OrphanedOnly() option and nextOrphanedTask() method. Priority ordering for auto mode is: (1) active epics, (2) ready epics, (3) standalone tasks --include-standalone, (4) orphaned tasks --include-orphans. The --all flag enables both standalone and orphans. All tests pass.",
