  "description": "Modify the NextTask method in internal/ticks/client.go to exclude tasks where awaiting is set:\n\nCurrent behavior:\n- Returns next open, unblocked, non-manual task\n\nNew behavior:\n- Returns next open, unblocked task where awaiting=null\n\nThis may require:\n1. Parsing JSON output from tk next --json\n2. Filtering locally if tk CLI doesn't support the filter yet\n3. Or updating the tk next command itself\n\nNote: Manual field check should be backwards-compatible (check both manual and awaiting).\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- [ ] tk next skips tasks with awaiting set\n- [ ] tk next skips tasks with manual=true (backwards compat)\n- [ ] Agent only receives tasks ready for agent work\n- [ ] Tests verify filtering behavior",
