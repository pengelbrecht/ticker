  "description": "When running ticker in watch mode and a human rejects a task:\n\nReproduction:\n1. Task y1m had requires=approval, agent completed it, routed to human  \n2. Human ran: tk reject y1m \"Please add timestamps\"\n3. Task returned to agent queue (awaiting=null, status=in_progress)\n4. tk next lyo correctly returns y1m as next ready task\n5. BUT ticker showed 'complete' modal: 'Epic completed successfully, 1/5 completed'\n\nExpected: Watch mode should detect y1m became available again and continue processing.\n\nActual: Watch mode thinks epic is complete. Shows '1/5 completed' even though y1m is ready.\n\nScreenshot shows:\n- Signal: COMPLETE  \n- Tasks: 1/5 completed\n- But y1m is in_progress with awaiting=null (should be picked up)\n\nRoot cause hypothesis:\n- tk next may not be finding y1m because it's in_progress (not open)?\n- Or watch mode polling doesn't re-check after rejection clears awaiting",
