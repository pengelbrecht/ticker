  "description": "Verify that worktree features work correctly with agent-human handoff:\n\nScenarios to verify:\n1. Agent hands off task → worktree should be preserved (not deleted)\n2. Human provides feedback → agent resumes in same worktree\n3. Multiple handoffs on same task → worktree state maintained\n4. Epic completion with handoffs → proper cleanup\n\nKey considerations:\n- Worktree is per-epic, not per-task\n- Handoffs within same epic should use same worktree\n- Only cleanup worktree when epic is fully done\n\nTest cases:\n```go\nfunc TestWorktreePreservedOnHandoff(t *testing.T) {\n    // 1. Start epic in worktree\n    // 2. Agent signals APPROVAL_NEEDED\n    // 3. Verify worktree still exists\n    // 4. Simulate human approval\n    // 5. Agent continues in same worktree\n}\n```\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- [ ] Worktree not deleted on handoff signals\n- [ ] Same worktree used after human response\n- [ ] Worktree cleaned up only on epic completion\n- [ ] Parallel handoffs to different epics isolated",
