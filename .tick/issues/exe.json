  "description": "## Problem\n\nRunning `ticker run \u003ctask-id\u003e` where the ID is a task (not an epic) causes the engine to close the task with reason \"no tasks found\".\n\nExample: `ticker run lgt` where `lgt` is a task under epic `8my`. Engine finds no child tasks and closes `lgt`.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nEngine should validate that the provided ID is an epic before running. If not an epic, error with clear message:\n\n```\nError: 'lgt' is a task, not an epic. Run 'ticker run 8my' to execute the parent epic.\n```\n\n## Fix Location\n\n### internal/engine/engine.go (or cmd/ticker/run.go)\n\nAdd validation before starting the run loop:\n\n```go\n// In Run() or before calling Run()\ntick, err := ticks.Get(epicID)\nif err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"getting tick: %w\", err)\n}\nif tick.Type != \"epic\" {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"'%s' is a %s, not an epic\", epicID, tick.Type)\n}\n```\n\n## Alternative\n\nCould also suggest the parent epic if the task has one:\n\n```\nError: 'lgt' is a task, not an epic.\nIts parent epic is '8my' (Phase 4: Worktrees \u0026 Parallel Execution).\nRun: ticker run 8my\n```",
