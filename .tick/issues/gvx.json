    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the epic notes and understanding the current task. The task is to \"Summarize findings after counting\" - this appears to be a summary task that depends on the counting task (el9) which was already completed.\n\nLet me first check the epic details and the related tasks to understand what needs to be summarized.I can see the task is to summarize findings after the count task (el9) is done. From the epic notes, I have the key information:\n\n- **el9 (Count Go files)**: Found 35 .go files in internal/ directory, spanning 9 packages: agent(6), budget(4), checkpoint(3), e2e(1), engine(7), ticks(5), tui(5), update(1).\n\nThis is a summarization task - no code changes needed. Let me verify the count is accurate and then close the task with a proper summary.The count confirms 35 .go files. Now let me close the task with a summary of the findings from the counting task.Task completed. This was an informational summary task - no code changes were needed. The findings from the counting task (el9) were:\n\n- **35 .go files** in the internal/ directory\n- **9 packages**: agent(6), budget(4), checkpoint(3), e2e(1), engine(7), ticks(5), tui(5), update(1)\n- **Largest packages**: engine (7 files), agent (6 files), tui (5 files), ticks (5 files)",
