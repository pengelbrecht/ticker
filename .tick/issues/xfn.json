  "description": "Improve visibility of selected task in TUI, especially when focus moves between panes.\n\n## Problems\n\n1. When focus moves to details pane, the cursor in task list disappears - user loses context of which task is selected\n2. No indication in status pane of which task is currently displayed\n3. Details pane doesn't show task ID and title header\n\n## Goals\n\n- Always clear which task is selected/displayed\n- Task context visible regardless of focused pane\n- Consistent task identification (ID + title) across panes",
