[git] M ticker | ?? .gitignore Please fix and close the task again.\n2026-01-13 09:31 - Iteration 2: Fixed verification failure for task dad. The ticker binary was being tracked in git, causing 'M ticker' in status. Removed it from git tracking and added to .gitignore.

Used glob pattern to enumerate all files. No code changes needed - read-only task.\n2026-01-13 09:34 - Iteration 6: Completed task g66. Generated project summary with rich markdown including: package comparison table (9 packages), code blocks showing 4 key type definitions (Agent, Limits/Tracker, RunConfig, Checkpoint), feature bullet list, signal protocol table, TUI keybindings table, and usage examples.
