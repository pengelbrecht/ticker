The previous iteration completed task 6f0 (reporting the module name as `github.com/pengelbrecht/ticker`), but verification failed due to a modified `.gitignore` file.\n\nLet me check the current git status and understand what's happening.\n\nThe working tree is clean now. The previous iteration's changes have been committed. Let me verify the module name in go.mod to confirm the answer.\n\nThe module name is `github.com/pengelbrecht/ticker` (line 1). The working tree is now clean, so the task can be closed.\n\nLet me close the task and add a note.\n\nTask 6f0 completed. The module name is **github.com/pengelbrecht/ticker** (from go.mod line 1). The working tree was already clean from iteration 3's commit, so no additional changes or commits were needed.",
