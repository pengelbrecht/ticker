  "description": "End-to-end tests for context generation in the engine.\n\n## Test Scenarios\n- [ ] Epic with 3 tasks: context generated before first task\n- [ ] Epic with 1 task: context generation skipped\n- [ ] Context already exists: generation skipped\n- [ ] Generation fails: run proceeds without context\n- [ ] Context injected into prompt correctly\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Tests use mock agent (no real API calls)\n- [ ] Tests create temp .ticker directory\n- [ ] Verify context file created at correct path\n- [ ] Verify prompt contains context section\n- [ ] Verify prompt omits context section when empty\n\n## Technical Notes\n- May need to refactor Engine for better testability\n- Consider adding context generation event to callbacks",
