    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the current task and understanding what needs to be done. I need to update a skill.md file with handoff signal documentation for LLM agents.\n\nLet me first explore the relevant files to understand the current state and what needs to be added.\n\nLet me search for skill-related files more broadly.\n\nI found the skill file at `/Users/peterengelbrecht/Development/ticker/skills/ticker/SKILL.md`. Let me read it along with the reference files to understand the current structure.\n\nNow I have a clear understanding of the current state. The SKILL.md has a basic \"Signal Protocol\" section with only 3 signals (COMPLETE, EJECT, BLOCKED). I need to update it with all 8 handoff signals, add format examples, document human feedback reading, and include information about pre-declared gates (requires field).\n\nLet me also check the engine's prompt.go to see how signals are documented there, as per the epic notes.\n\nNow I have all the context I need. Let me update the SKILL.md to include:\n\n1. All 8 signal types in a detailed table (replacing the old 3-signal section)\n2. Format examples for each signal\n3. Human feedback section\n4. Pre-declared gates (requires field) documentation\n\nNow let me run a quick review to make sure the SKILL.md file looks complete and well-formatted.\n\nThe SKILL.md has been updated successfully. Now let me run the tests to ensure everything passes.\n\nAll tests pass. Now let me close the task and commit the changes.\n\nNow let me add an epic note for future iterations.\n\nI have completed the task. Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n**Task [jur]: Update ticker skill.md with handoff signals**\n\nUpdated `/Users/peterengelbrecht/Development/ticker/skills/ticker/SKILL.md` with comprehensive handoff signal documentation:\n\n1. **All 8 signal types documented** - Added a complete table with all signals: COMPLETE, APPROVAL_NEEDED, INPUT_NEEDED, REVIEW_REQUESTED, CONTENT_REVIEW, ESCALATE, CHECKPOINT, EJECT (plus legacy BLOCKED)\n\n2. **Format examples provided** - Added an XML code block with examples for each signal type showing the proper format with context\n\n3. **Human feedback section documented** - Added \"Reading Human Feedback\" section explaining how to find and respond to human feedback in task notes\n\n4. **Pre-declared gates documented** - Added \"Pre-Declared Gates (requires field)\" section explaining the approval, review, and content gates that humans can set on tasks\n\n5. **Detailed usage guidance** - Added \"When to Use Each Signal\" section with bullet points for each signal explaining appropriate use cases\n\nThe skill documentation now aligns with the prompt.go template and the AGENT_HUMAN_WORKFLOW.md reference document.",
