  "description": "Add visual status indicators for agent-human workflow states in the TUI. Includes:\n1. File watching to refresh TUI when ticks change externally\n2. New status icons using cohesive emoji style\n3. Display awaiting states (approval, input, review, etc.)\n\nEmoji style guide:\n- ⚪ Open (ready for agent)\n- 🔵 In Progress (agent working)\n- ✅ Closed/Done\n- 🔴 Blocked (by another task)\n- 👤 Awaiting Human (any awaiting state)\n\nRefs: docs/AGENT_HUMAN_WORKFLOW.md",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 23:39 - Task 2d6 complete: Added Awaiting field to TaskInfo struct. The field is ready to be populated from tick data and used in StatusIcon() method. Next tasks will need to: 1) Parse awaiting field from tk output when refreshing tasks, 2) Update StatusIcon() to show 👤 icon when Awaiting is non-empty.\n2026-01-14 23:42 - Task nu3 complete: StatusIcon() now uses emoji style (⚪🔵✅🔴👤). Awaiting field support is fully implemented - when Awaiting is non-empty, shows 👤 icon with colorPeach. Priority order: awaiting→blocked→in_progress→closed→open. Next task (zyv) should implement file watching to auto-refresh TUI when .tick/ files change, which will then populate the Awaiting field from tk output.\n2026-01-14 23:44 - Task ok0 complete: Awaiting state is now wired from ticks to TUI. Both refreshTasks() and loadTasksForEpic() in cmd/ticker/main.go now populate the Awaiting field using t.GetAwaitingType(). The TUI StatusIcon() already supports showing 👤 for awaiting tasks (implemented in nu3). The full awaiting workflow is now functional. When file watching (zyv) is implemented, the TUI will automatically refresh and show updated awaiting states when .tick/ files change.\n2026-01-14 23:45 - Task b2n complete: Added file watcher to TUI in runWithTUI(). When .tick/issues files change externally, refreshTasks() is called automatically. Uses existing TicksWatcher from internal/engine/watcher.go. The watcher debounces rapid changes (100ms default) and only watches .json files. The Changes() channel returns nil if fsnotify is unavailable, in which case the TUI falls back to its existing refresh mechanism. All agent-human workflow status indicators are now implemented: awaiting field (2d6), emoji status icons (nu3), awaiting state wiring (ok0), and file watching (b2n).\n2026-01-14 23:47 - Task 4ds complete: Updated getTabStatusIcon() in tabs.go to use emoji style (🔵🔴✅⚠) matching task StatusIcon(). All visual status indicators in the TUI now use a consistent emoji style: tasks (⚪🔵✅🔴👤) and tabs (🔵✅🔴⚠). The ⚠ is intentionally kept for tab conflicts as it has different meaning from task blocked state (🔴).\n2026-01-14 23:49 - Task 2b8 complete: Added 8 comprehensive test functions to model_test.go covering all StatusIcon() emoji icons and Awaiting field handling. Tests verify: all 5 icons (⚪🔵✅🔴👤), awaiting priority (highest), blocked priority (over open only), edge cases for in_progress/closed with blockers, and TasksUpdateMsg propagation. All TUI agent-human workflow tests now in place. The epic should be complete - all tasks (2d6, nu3, ok0, b2n, 4ds, 2b8) are done.\n2026-01-14 23:51 - Task jx9 complete: RenderTask() now displays awaiting type in brackets after the title when Awaiting field is set (e.g., 👤 [abc] Fix auth flow [approval]). Uses peach color (colorPeach) matching the human icon. Tests cover approval/input/review/content types and verifies no brackets for non-awaiting tasks. All agent-human workflow status indicators are now fully implemented across the epic (2d6, nu3, ok0, b2n, 4ds, 2b8, jx9).",
