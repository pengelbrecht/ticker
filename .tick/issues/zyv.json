  "notes": "2026-01-14 23:39 - Task 2d6 complete: Added Awaiting field to TaskInfo struct. The field is ready to be populated from tick data and used in StatusIcon() method. Next tasks will need to: 1) Parse awaiting field from tk output when refreshing tasks, 2) Update StatusIcon() to show 👤 icon when Awaiting is non-empty.",
