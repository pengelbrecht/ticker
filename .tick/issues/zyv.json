  "description": "Add visual status indicators for agent-human workflow states in the TUI. Includes:\n1. File watching to refresh TUI when ticks change externally\n2. New status icons using cohesive emoji style\n3. Display awaiting states (approval, input, review, etc.)\n\nEmoji style guide:\n- ⚪ Open (ready for agent)\n- 🔵 In Progress (agent working)\n- ✅ Closed/Done\n- 🔴 Blocked (by another task)\n- 👤 Awaiting Human (any awaiting state)\n\nRefs: docs/AGENT_HUMAN_WORKFLOW.md",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 23:39 - Task 2d6 complete: Added Awaiting field to TaskInfo struct. The field is ready to be populated from tick data and used in StatusIcon() method. Next tasks will need to: 1) Parse awaiting field from tk output when refreshing tasks, 2) Update StatusIcon() to show 👤 icon when Awaiting is non-empty.\n2026-01-14 23:42 - Task nu3 complete: StatusIcon() now uses emoji style (⚪🔵✅🔴👤). Awaiting field support is fully implemented - when Awaiting is non-empty, shows 👤 icon with colorPeach. Priority order: awaiting→blocked→in_progress→closed→open. Next task (zyv) should implement file watching to auto-refresh TUI when .tick/ files change, which will then populate the Awaiting field from tk output.\n2026-01-14 23:44 - Task ok0 complete: Awaiting state is now wired from ticks to TUI. Both refreshTasks() and loadTasksForEpic() in cmd/ticker/main.go now populate the Awaiting field using t.GetAwaitingType(). The TUI StatusIcon() already supports showing 👤 for awaiting tasks (implemented in nu3). The full awaiting workflow is now functional. When file watching (zyv) is implemented, the TUI will automatically refresh and show updated awaiting states when .tick/ files change.",
