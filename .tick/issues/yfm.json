  "closed_reason": "Added GetRunRecord() method to ticks.Client to read RunRecord from tick JSON files. Updated refreshTasks() in main.go to fetch RunRecords for closed tasks and send TaskRunRecordMsg to TUI. The buildRunRecordContent() function was already comprehensive - the issue was that TaskRunRecordMsg was never being sent. Now when tasks are refreshed, closed tasks with run data will display the rich RunRecord view (metrics, tools, thinking, output)."
