  "description": "Update the test epic generation script to create multiple epics suitable for testing parallel execution.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe existing `scripts/create-test-epic.sh` creates a single test epic. Expand it to also generate multiple independent epics that can be used to test parallel worktree execution.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n### scripts/create-test-epic.sh\n\nAdd a new mode or separate function to create parallel test epics:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Usage:\n#   ./scripts/create-test-epic.sh           # Create single test epic (existing)\n#   ./scripts/create-test-epic.sh parallel  # Create 3 parallel test epics\n\nif [ \"$1\" = \"parallel\" ]; then\n    create_parallel_test_epics\nelse\n    create_single_test_epic\nfi\n```\n\n## Parallel Test Epics Design\n\nCreate 3 independent epics that:\n1. Don't modify the same files (avoid merge conflicts for happy path testing)\n2. Have different task counts (test different completion times)\n3. Are simple enough to complete quickly\n\n### Epic A: Documentation Tasks (2 tasks)\n- Task A1: Create docs/TESTING.md\n- Task A2: Add testing section to README.md\n\n### Epic B: Script Tasks (3 tasks)  \n- Task B1: Create scripts/hello.sh\n- Task B2: Create scripts/goodbye.sh\n- Task B3: Create scripts/README.md\n\n### Epic C: Config Tasks (2 tasks)\n- Task C1: Create .ticker/test-config.json\n- Task C2: Create .ticker/README.md\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Each epic creates files in different directories (no conflicts)\n- Tasks are trivial (create file with content) so they complete fast\n- Output epic IDs at end for easy copy-paste:\n  ```\n  Parallel test epics created:\n    Epic A: abc123\n    Epic B: def456\n    Epic C: ghi789\n  \n  Run with: ticker run abc123 def456 ghi789 --parallel 3\n  ```\n\n## Optional: Conflict Test Epics\n\nAdd a second mode for testing merge conflicts:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/create-test-epic.sh conflict  # Create epics that WILL conflict\n```\n\nThese epics would both modify the same file, guaranteeing a merge conflict for testing the conflict handling workflow.",
