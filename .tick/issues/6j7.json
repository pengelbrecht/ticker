    "output": "I'll review the epic notes and understand the situation. The previous iteration completed task 6j7 (calculating 2+2=4), but verification failed due to uncommitted changes. Let me check what changes are outstanding and fix them.\n\nThese look like legitimate improvements from a previous task (adding manual task support and improving TUI task refresh). I need to commit these changes and then close task 6j7.\n\nLet me first check if the task is already closed:\n\nThe task is still open. Looking at the notes:\n- Task 6j7 was \"completed\" (answer is 4), but verification failed due to uncommitted changes.\n\nThe answer to 2+2 is 4. The previous iteration got this correct. I need to:\n1. Commit the outstanding changes\n2. Close the task\n3. Add an epic note\n\nThere's still a modified file. Let me check what changed:\n\nThis is also a related change that needs to be committed. Let me add this to the commit:\n\nAll modified files are now committed. The checkpoint file is expected to be untracked.\n\nTask 6j7 is complete:\n- **Answer**: 2+2 = 4\n- **Issue resolved**: Committed all outstanding changes that caused verification failure\n- **Task closed** with reason\n- **Epic note added** for future iterations",
