  "description": "Extend signal detection to support all 8 handoff signal types. Implement signal → awaiting mapping. Update engine loop to continue after handoff signals. Build context with human feedback notes.",
  "notes": "2026-01-14 18:25 - Completed ux4: Added 6 new handoff signal constants (SignalApprovalNeeded, SignalInputNeeded, SignalReviewRequested, SignalContentReview, SignalEscalate, SignalCheckpoint). SignalBlocked kept for backward compatibility. Note: ParseSignals() in signals.go still only detects COMPLETE/EJECT/BLOCKED - a future task will need to extend detection for the new signals.\n2026-01-14 18:32 - Completed vyb: Human feedback notes now included in prompt context. Uses existing GetHumanNotes() from ticks client. Added HumanFeedback []ticks.Note field to IterationContext, fetched in runIteration. Template displays in dedicated section before Instructions. Tests cover with-feedback, nil, and empty-slice cases.\n2026-01-14 18:34 - Completed tps: ParseSignals now detects all 8 signal types using unified pattern map. signalPatterns maps strings to constants, signalPriority defines precedence. Single regex: `\u003cpromise\u003e(\\w+)(?::\\s*(.+?))?\u003c/promise\u003e` handles signals with/without context. All 41 tests pass including 20 new tests for handoff signals.",
