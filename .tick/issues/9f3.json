    "output": "I'll review the epic notes first. I see that:\n\n1. Iteration 1 calculated 3+3=6 (correct answer)\n2. Verification failed due to uncommitted changes in the git status\n\nThe issue is that there are uncommitted changes in the repository that need to be addressed before the task can be properly closed. Let me check the current git status and commit the outstanding changes.\n\nAll tests pass. Now I'll commit the outstanding changes and then close the task.\n\nChanges committed. Now let me close the task and add a note to the epic.\n\nTask completed. \n\n**Summary:**\n- **Answer**: 3+3 = 6\n- **Issue fixed**: The previous iteration calculated the correct answer but verification failed because there were uncommitted changes in the repository (cmd/ticker/main.go, internal/parallel/runner.go, internal/parallel/runner_test.go, internal/tui/model.go)\n- **Solution**: Committed the outstanding changes and closed the task\n- Added an epic note for future iterations",
