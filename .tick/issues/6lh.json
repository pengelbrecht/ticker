Includes: Model struct with width/height/ready/keys/help fields, keyMap with navigation bindings and help.KeyMap interface implementation, NewModel() constructor, Init() returning nil, Update() handling WindowSizeMsg and KeyMsg, View() with placeholder and help. Also fixed doc.go to have valid package declaration. TUI package compiles independently; main.go updates will come in task pjf."
