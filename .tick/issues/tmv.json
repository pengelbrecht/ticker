  "description": "When running `./ticker run \u003cepic\u003e --headless`, output is not being displayed to stdout.\n\nObserved behavior:\n- Ticker runs and completes tasks (verified via tk notes/list)\n- But no output is shown in the terminal\n- The system mentions output is being written to a file but the file isn't accessible\n\nFiles to investigate:\n- internal/engine/headless_output.go - headless output formatting\n- cmd/ticker/main.go - headless mode setup (look for --headless flag handling)\n\nPotential issues:\n1. Output buffering not being flushed\n2. Output going to wrong stream (stderr vs stdout)\n3. Output writer not properly connected\n4. Goroutine output not reaching main thread",
