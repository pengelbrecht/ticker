  "description": "Most users run ticker on Claude subscription where cost is irrelevant. Changes needed:\n\n1. Set DefaultMaxCost to 0 (disabled) in engine.go\n2. When maxCost is 0/disabled, skip cost budget checks\n3. Update status pane to show just 'Cost: $X.XX' without target when disabled\n4. Update completion modal similarly\n5. Keep --max-cost flag for users who want to set a limit\n\nCurrent default of $20 causes unnecessary stops for subscription users.",

Budget tracker already handles MaxCost=0 as unlimited, TUI already shows just cost without target when maxCost=0."
