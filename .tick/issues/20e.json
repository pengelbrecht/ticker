  "description": "Measure actual token savings by comparing runs with and without context.\n\n## Experiment Design\n1. Select an epic with 5+ tasks\n2. Run once WITHOUT context (baseline)\n3. Run same epic WITH context enabled\n4. Compare total tokens used\n\n## Metrics to Capture\n- [ ] Total tokens per task (with context)\n- [ ] Total tokens per task (without context)\n- [ ] Context generation token cost\n- [ ] Net token savings percentage\n- [ ] Task completion time comparison\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Document baseline token usage\n- [ ] Document with-context token usage\n- [ ] Calculate ROI (generation cost vs savings)\n- [ ] Savings \u003e 30% for 5+ task epics\n- [ ] Report created with findings\n\n## Human Workflow\n1. Create test epic with 5 representative tasks\n2. Run with context disabled, record metrics\n3. Reset/recreate epic\n4. Run with context enabled, record metrics\n5. Compare and document findings",
