  "description": "Keep the selection cursor visible in the task list even when focus is on another pane.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nWhen user presses Tab to move focus to details/output pane, the highlight/cursor on the selected task in the task list disappears.\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\n- Cursor remains visible but with different styling (e.g., dimmed, different color, or outline instead of filled)\n- Focused pane has bright/active cursor style\n- Unfocused pane has dim/inactive cursor style\n\n## Implementation\n\n### internal/tui/model.go\n\nIn task list rendering, check if pane is focused:\n\n```go\nfunc (m *Model) renderTaskLine(task TaskInfo, selected bool, width int) string {\n    if selected {\n        if m.focusedPane == PaneTaskList {\n            // Active selection - bright highlight\n            return activeSelectedStyle.Render(line)\n        } else {\n            // Inactive selection - dimmed highlight  \n            return inactiveSelectedStyle.Render(line)\n        }\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Nice to Have\n\nThis is lower priority - implement if straightforward, skip if complex.",
